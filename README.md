## Project 1: Statistical Analysis for Simple Linear Regression

### Aim

This project revolves around the integration of statistical tools with the development of an interactive application that performs statistical analyses, particularly focusing on the concept of simple linear regression within industrial applications. Our primary solution is built using the R programming language. The goal is to provide users with an efficient tool for conducting statistical analysis.

### Features

- **R Shiny App:** We've built a user-friendly interface using the R Shiny package. The app allows users to input parameters through graphical controls like sliders, drop-downs, and text fields.
- **Real-time Analysis:** The app dynamically modifies outputs as users interact with the interface. Every change in input selection immediately updates the corresponding outputs.
- **Data Integration:** Users can upload their own datasets, enabling personalized analysis based on specific conditions and requirements.
- **Online Access:** You can access the live version of the app [here](http://simplelinearregressioncp.shinyapps.io/Myapp).

### Skills Utilized

- **R Programming:** The core logic of the app is implemented in R, utilizing its powerful statistical capabilities.
- **R Shiny:** We've harnessed the capabilities of the R Shiny package to develop the interactive user interface.
- **RStudio:** Our development environment of choice, RStudio, facilitated the smooth creation and testing of the application.
